This is an official plugin for C42 OS. It provides an interactive dashboard to model, visualize, and analyze the complex risks associated with AI adoption across various demographic and industrial cohorts.

The plugin leverages a generative AI model to provide qualitative risk analysis, acting as an expert advisor to help decision-makers understand the potential impacts of their strategies.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Scenario Modeling:** Use intuitive sliders to adjust adoption parameters (`t₀`, `k`, `w`) for multiple cohorts in real-time.
- **Multi-Cohort Analysis:** Simultaneously model both Generational (Gen Z, Millennials, etc.) and Industry (Finance, Healthcare, etc.) cohorts.
- **Dynamic Visualization:** Adoption curves, velocity charts, and concentration risk (HHI) are rendered instantly using responsive charts.
- **Advanced Risk Metrics:** Automatically calculates and displays key indicators like Peak HHI, Cascade Vulnerability, Time-to-90% Adoption, and Area Under the Curve (AUC).
- **AI-Powered Analysis:** A "Get AI Analysis" button provides a qualitative risk assessment of the current scenario, generated by an AI model.

## How It Works: A C42 OS Plugin

This application is designed from the ground up to function as a first-class citizen within the C42 OS ecosystem. It operates in two modes:

### 1. As a C42 OS Plugin (Integrated Mode)

When loaded inside the C42 OS `iframe`, the plugin automatically detects the environment and uses the `C42_SDK` for all host interactions.

- **Secure AI Calls:** It uses `sdk.request('generate_response', ...)` to ask the C42 Kernel to generate the AI analysis. **The plugin never handles API keys directly**, inheriting the security and credentials of the host OS.
- **Live Theme Syncing:** It uses `sdk.subscribe('theme_change', ...)` to listen for theme changes from the host, instantly switching between light and dark modes to match the user's OS-level preference.

### 2. In Standalone Mode (For Development)

If the `C42_SDK` is not detected, the application gracefully falls back to a standalone mode.

- **Direct API Calls:** It uses the `GoogleGenAI` library directly. This requires an `API_KEY` to be present in the environment variables, intended for local development and testing.
- **System Theme Preference:** It respects the `(prefers-color-scheme: dark)` media query to set its initial theme.

## Getting Started

### Inside C42 OS
No installation is needed. Simply open the "AI Risk Advisor" from the Applications menu in C42 OS. The plugin will be loaded and run securely by the Kernel.

### For Local Development
1.  Ensure you have a local web server (e.g., `npx serve`).
2.  Create a `.env` file at the root of the project with your `API_KEY` for the Gemini API if you intend to test the AI analysis feature.
3.  Serve the project's root directory.
4.  Open `index.html` in your browser.

## C42 OS Compliance

This plugin is fully compliant with the C42 OS development standards.

- ✅ **SDK Integration:** Built against `C42_SDK` version 2.0. See `SDK_DOCUMENTATION.md`.
- ✅ **Design System:** Implements `C42 OS Unified Design System` version 1.5, including the full light/dark mode color palette. See `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md`.
- ✅ **Security:** Follows the principle of least privilege by delegating sensitive actions (like AI requests) to the Kernel, as outlined in `SECURITY.md`.
- ✅ **Contribution:** Feedback and bug reports should follow the guidelines in the main C42 OS `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
